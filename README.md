### Technologies Used

* React
* JavaScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB

### Challenges and Unsolved Problems
Got the CRUD functionality working pretty quickly, but struggled with Tailwind so didn't have time to do several things, most notably ...
* On Show page, want to make another API request using different parameters so I can access more data about the movie (actors, director, plot, etc)
* Delete needs to redirect to /favorites instead of refreshing the browser 
* Need to fix cards so they display correctly
